# CracklingFire
Ceramic fireplace had a boring single white always ON LED.  This was replaced with three WS2812B leds and an mp3 player device (DFR0299).  
<p>Now fireplace looks and sounds much more like a fireplace.</p>
<p>After a brief search of the hardware developers website, I found;<br>
"...if you find the noise is quite loud, then you could attach an 1K resistor to the TX pin"<br>
This did in fact correct the noise issue.</p>
