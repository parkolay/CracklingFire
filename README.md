# CracklingFire
Ceramic fireplace had a boring single white always ON LED.  This was replaced with three WS2812B leds and an mp3 player device (DFR0299).  
Now fireplace looks and sounds much more like a fireplace.  
After a brief search of the hardware developers website, I found;
"if you find the noise is quite loud, then you could attach an 1K resistor to the TX pin"
This did in fact correct the noise issue.
